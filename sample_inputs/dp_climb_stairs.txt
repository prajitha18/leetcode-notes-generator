Problem:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.  
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.  
In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Approach:
Use dynamic programming. The number of ways to reach step i is the sum of ways to reach (i-1) and (i-2).

Code:
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    a, b = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
