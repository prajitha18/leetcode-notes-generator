Topic: Arrays

Problem:
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

Approach:
Use two pointers from start and end since the array is sorted.

Code:
def twoSum(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        total = arr[left] + arr[right]
        if total == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif total < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
